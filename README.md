**MakeRequest Example**

```python
request = webpt.make_request(url, method='POST', data="param1=val1&param2=val2").request
```

```python
request = webpt.make_request(url).request
```


**Vuln Example**

```python
res = webpt.vuln.clickjacking(url)
```
* Poc can be exported using the following command:

get_links = webpt.spider("https://example.com").links
```

```python 
print(webpt.spider("https://example.com").gui)
```

**HTML Analysis - Response Analysis Example**
```python
src = requests.get(f'https://www.example.co.il/').text
tags = webpt.find(src).tag("form")
for tag in tags:
    webpt.send_form(tag.element).change("sadasda", "sahar")
```
```python
tags = webpt.find(source).tag("a")
for tag in tags:
    res = tag.attr("href")
```
```python
tags = webpt.find(source).tag("a").list
for tag in tags:
    webpt.element(tags[0])
```
```python
mails = webpt.find(source).mails()
```

```python
IP = webpt.myip()
```
```python
full_name = webpt.call_attr({"first": "Sahar", "last": "Avitan"})

## Version
**Current version is 2.2.9**

## What's new

* From the new webpt update you can scan subdomains with the highest results
(Example code above) - ```.subdomains()```

* In the new update you can search for vulnerabilities automatically with a webpt.
12 vulnerabilities have been added, more to come soon.
(Example code above) - ```.vuln```

* Forms that exist on the site can be sent with a change of parameter / value.
(Example code above) - ```.send_form()```

* Element can be analyzed according to Attributes and value, Return in Dict. (Example code above) - ```.element()```

* What's my IP? (Example code above) - ```.myip()```

* In the new update you can encrypt and decrypt the following types:
```md5, sha1, sha256, sha512```.
To decrypt these hash (```md5, sha1, sha256, sha512```) you have to perform Brute Force that we wrote specifically.
(Example code above) - ```.hash()```

* You can insert a dictionary for a function called ```.call_attr()```, Once we call the function we can put "." at the end,
And add a key in the dictionary.

* Parts of the code have been ```repaired``` and ```improved```

* License updated to ```Apache License```
